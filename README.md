# note-convert

> If you encounter problems related to [resource limitations](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/limits/overview), it is recommended to clone the code for local use

**WIP**

This is a website that converts your notes between different platforms.
Currently it supports:

- memos -> local
  - export all your notes, including resource files

## Other

For syncing memos in obsidian, you can use [obsidian-memos-plugin](https://github.com/hyoban/obsidian-memos-plugin)
